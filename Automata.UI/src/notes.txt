Finite State Machines

1) Determine if a machine is deterministic.  Will need to analyze character classes and look for overlaps out of any state.  Also make sure all chars in sigma
are represented out of every state.
2) Info page: Build table as is from machine.  Also note whether or not it is deterministic and show associated regular expression (both formats).
3) Determinism page: If non-deterministic, show a deterministic version (read only and small) with an associated table and a button to overwrite the non-deterministic version
with the deterministic one.

4) Simulate: Enter text, click simulate
    a) If deterministic, show each configuration or not accepted.
    b) If non-deterministic, show each configuration with branching or not accepted

Push Down Automata

1) Define machine by adding rules or by creating a context free grammar (and calculate the other based on the entry)
2) Info will show both cfg and pda.
3) Ignore determinism and just simulate, showing all configurations, and non-deterministic branches
